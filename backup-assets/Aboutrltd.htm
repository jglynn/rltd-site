When John Glynn talks about his wife, he describes many aspects of her 
personality. Kimberly Pierce loved her family and the arts; she also loved to 
read, write, travel and learn new things.<br>
<br>
Glynn of Elko New Market is combining several of those items into a reading 
foundation in memory of his late wife. Kimberly died of cancer in 2007.<br>
<br>
While some elements of the foundation have already been established - a business 
account and a tax identification number, other items are taking some time.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've got a lot more ideas than I know what to do with,&quot; said Glynn in a phone 
conversation from his home.<br>
<br>
He's considered opening up a new and used book store to help bring in funds, 
with proceeds donated to the Elko New Market Library and Eagle View Elementary 
School in the form of books or money. Another option he pondered was providing 
tutoring to students who wanted to learn a foreign language.<br>
<br>
The foundation will be known as &quot;Read Like the Dickens,&quot; which is a twist on a 
race in Galveston, TX, called Run Like the Dickens.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kim used to run small marathons,&quot; Glynn explained, adding that Kim's sister 
lived in Galveston and when Kim visited, she would participate in the race.<br>
<br>
Kim's love of running inspired Glynn to start a race in Elko New Market. He's 
already approached the city council about holding it during the annual Fire &amp; 
Rescue Days celebration. The council liked the idea of having a fund-raising 
race at the event, which is organized by the local Firefighters Relief 
Association. Now, Glynn is working to get it going.<br>
<br>
&quot;I look at the clock, and I wonder how am I going to get it done,&quot; he said of 
all of his ideas. &quot;I want to get it off the ground, so I'm thinking nothing 
flamboyant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Glynn wants the race to be five kilometers long, keeping it within city limits 
and open it to runners of different athletic levels.<br>
<br>
<b>A woman of many dimensions</b><br>
<br>
Glynn's description of Kim paints a renaissance woman. Athletic, curious, 
artistic, a wife and a mom who picked up her love of travel from her family.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kim was originally from Utah,&quot; he noted, adding that her family lived for three 
years in England and three years in Germany. Kim received her first years of 
schooling in those countries and didn't go to school in the United States until 
seventh grade.<br>
<br>
&quot;The family takes pride in calling themselves gypsies,&quot; he added.<br>
<br>
While Kim loved reading, she also learned how to write. &quot;She was a journalist. 
She was always writing,&quot; Glynn noted.<br>
<br>
She worked for papers at her various schools and while in college. Kim 
eventually studied in Salzburg, Austria. For eight years, she worked for the 
Associated Press, interviewing such people as actress Julie Andrews.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kim really had an ability to reach out and recognize people,&quot; said Glynn, 
explaining that she saw some things in people others would have missed. He 
related how she wrote a thank-you note to a staff member at a hospital where she 
stayed while she was ill. While the work was menial, Kim noticed the person did 
a thorough job and took pride in it.<br>
<br>
Hospitals were something Kim and her family grew accustomed to after she was 
diagnosed with cancer in 2004.<br>
<br>
&quot;She told the doctors, 'I'm not going to be one of your statistics,'&quot; said 
Glynn, adding that she fought wholeheartedly with dignity and pride for three 
years. &quot;She hardly complained at all, and she kept her spirits up,&quot; he added.<br>
<br>
Since Kim died last July, Glynn has been busy not only with the foundation, but 
also being a single dad. He's adopted Ellie and Zeke Pierce, who are in first 
and second grades respectively. Glynn told them he was going to establish &quot;Read 
Like the Dickens&quot; in memory of their mom.<br>
<br>
&quot;They loved the idea,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
A love of reading is something Kim and Glynn had already started to pass onto 
the children.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are pictures of them falling asleep, buried in books,&quot; he said, adding 
that the family has more than enough books at home. &quot;We don't have enough 
bookshelves for all the books we have.&quot; <br>
<br>
He recently donated some of the books to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter 
Day Saints in New Prague. <br>
<br>
The &quot;Read Like the Dickens&quot; foundation is set up at New Market Bank where 
donations can be sent.</font></p>
