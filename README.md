Read Like the Dickens Charity Site
[readlikethedickens.org](http://readlikethedickens.org/)

Read Like the Dickens is a foundation started in memory of John Glynn's late wife Kimberly, who passed away in July 2007 of cancer ([related article](http://readlikethedickens.org/article.html)). Kimberly Pierce loved her family and the arts; she also loved to read, write, travel, run and learn new things. A love of reading is something Kim and John had already started to pass onto the children at an early age. As a result of this passion, the "Read Like the Dickens" foundation has been set up at New Market Bank where donations can be sent. All monies raised from foundation events will be donated to the New Market Public Library.
